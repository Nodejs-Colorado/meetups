## Formats

### Lightning Talks, Demos, etc

The NodeAZ meetup happens once per month on the 3rd Monday at 7pm.
It always happens at the same venue, [University of Advancing Technology](http://www.uat.edu/â€Ž),
although it has changed rooms a few times as we have grown.

The meetup doesn't have a scheduled length or agenda.  People are encouraged to
show up with demos of projects or interesting things they have seen.  The length
tends to end up being 3+ hours, but people don't go anywhere after because nothing
is in walking distance in Phoenix.

The intended audience is advanced JavaScripters, but recent meetups have been
attended by people just entering the JS space.  They are encouraged to ask questions,
but we also had a full-day training/workshop for them in October 2013 and I think it will
become a regular thing.

## Process

There is 0 process to the meetup.  The location is reserved, the date always stays the same,
and people just show up with stuff they want to demo or talk about.  No type of recording
or streaming is done, since it is just a casual atmosphere.
