## formats

### talk night

Node Brigade’s talk nights don’t currently follow a consistent schedule, but are announced through the [Meetup group](http://www.meetup.com/node-brigade-vancouver/). They consist of two long-form (30-45 minute) talks.

After each presentation, there’s an opportunity for the audience to ask any questions. After both presentations are done, there is plenty of time to chat with the presenters and the rest of the group.

After the meetup, Node Brigade usually relocates as a group to one of a few nearby bars.

## process

@silentrob and @sintaxi actively seek out speakers from the community.
