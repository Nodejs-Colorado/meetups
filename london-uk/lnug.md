## Formats

### Talk Night

Talk nights are held every 4th Wednesday of the month. They are usually
comprised of three talks with a short break in between.

After the meetup, we relocate as a group to one of a few nearby bars.

## Process

The organizers facilitate the speakers, the venue, and the food -- feedback can
be sent directly to them either on Twitter or in person.
