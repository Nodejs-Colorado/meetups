### Presentations

We don't have a regular day each month that we meet but we try and schedule it at least a month out to let you have time to schedule it. The talks are typically educational in nature and are aimed towards Node.js newcomers. We have one speaker per night and encourage everyone to ask questions after the talk or in person before or after the presentation.

We typically meet at a venue that provides drinks and various other goodies, they'll be noted on the meetup pages.

### Want to speak?

If you would like to present, tweet us or send us a message on Meetup and we'd be glad to have you speak!
