## Formats

### Presentations, Demos, and Social

Node.Cincy happens on the 2nd Wednesday of each month at
[The Brandery](http://brandery.org) and includes a presentation followed by the
chance for anybody to demo what they are building with node.js. After the
presentations and demos, it's open to social interaction; a chance for people to
provide or receive help with their projects or talk about the latest Hacker News
hot drama.

Pizza and drinks are provided so come hungry and thirsty.

## Process

There are some great local developers working with node.js that love to share
what they have going on. They present both their personal and professional
projects to give you an idea of what problems they are solving with node.js.

The organizers facilitate the speakers, the venue, and the food -- feedback can
be sent directly to them either on Twitter or in person.
