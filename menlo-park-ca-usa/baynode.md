## Formats

### Talk Night

Talk nights are held roughly once a month at ASTi Labs' office in Silicon Valley Pad (Menlo Park, CA). They are usually
comprised of either one 15 minute lightning talk with two long-form (30-45 minute)
talks or three 15 minute lightning talks.  Attendees are encouraged to ask questions and interact with the speaker
(in a polite way!)

### Hack Night

Hack nights are held roughly once a month, typically at LinkedIn's Mountain View office. The structure is free-form with a focus on socializing and hacking. Organizers greet newbies and ask what they'd like to work on or if they have any projects they'd like help with. Those new to Node are directed to learning resources, including [nodeschool.io](http://nodeschool.io).

## Process

Talks are submitted via PR and reviewed by organizers. Talk templates are 
provided. Note that this is not a case of "build it and they will come".
Organizers actively seek out and encourage talks from community members. 
Newer members are encouraged to do lightning talks. Topics include packages 
they've recently released or found useful, tooling, and brief tutorials.

There's also a "request for talk" to allow members who are interested in
a topic request to hear about it at a future meetup. The request provides
inspiration for those who want to give a talk.

Once a talk is accepted it is placed in a `YYYY-MM` directory. Additional
talk resources should be added / linked to from there (presentations, code
examples, etc.)
