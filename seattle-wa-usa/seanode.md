## formats

### talk night

Talk nights are idealistically once per month, but are currently scheduled
ad-hoc.

The meetings start with food and beverages, typically provided by the host
venue. Following food/drinks, the talks typically consist of two 30 minute
presentations, sometimes followed by a few lightning talks (~5 minutes each)

Following the presentations there is an opportunity to continue chatting and
the speakers are available to answer questions.

## process

Talks can be submitted via PR at the github repository, or by contacting any
of the organizers.
