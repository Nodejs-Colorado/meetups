## Format

We meet once a month in the event room of a bar in Cobble Hill called [61 Local](http://www.61local.com/). Tickets are $10/$15/$20 dollars, depending on when a ticket is purchased, and all proceeds go to charity. Historically we have been splitting between [Girls Who Code](http://www.girlswhocode.com/) and [ScriptEd](http://scripted.org/), but we are open to taking suggestions from the community for more organizations, preferably NYC-based.

We do things lightning talk style: five 10 minute slots, with 5 minutes for speaking and 5 minutes for questions. After the talks, everyone goes downstairs for the beer.js portion of the evening to enjoy local beers and sodas. The ticket comes with a custom 3D printed token that can be redeemed for a beverage of choice.

## Process

We accept talk proposals through pull request: whoever wants to give a talk [makes a PR to the website](https://github.com/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io) adding their name to the schedule. We actively encourage members of the community to submit talks, especially if they have not spoken before. Those who submit talks also get first dibs on tickets, even if their proposal is not accepted.
