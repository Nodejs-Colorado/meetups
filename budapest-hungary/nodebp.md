## Formats

### Talk Night

Talk nights are held once in every month. They are usually
comprised of three 20 minute-long talks with a short break in between.

After the meetup, we relocate as a group to one of a few nearby bars.

### Beer Night

Only one talk (40 minutes or so) for this type of event, just to create a friendly atmosphere.
After that we stay at a pub, drinking crafted beer, and talking Node.

### Workshops

None for now, we will hold our first workshop in March (featuring Nodeschool)

## Process

The talks are discussed via GitHub issues, and three are chosen from the most
popular ones every month. The talks are recorded, and can be viewed on youtube
(www.youtube.com/user/nodebp)

Once a talk is accepted the presentation will be forked under our repo.
