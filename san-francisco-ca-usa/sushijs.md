## format

### eat sushi and discuss

At SushiJS, JavaScript engineers, and others interested in the language,
come together to eat sushi and discuss. There’s no formal talks or
presentations, just discussions with the people sitting at the table
around you.

## process

Meetings are planned and RSVP’d using GitHub issues and usually happen
about once a month. “Watch” the repository to get emails and notifications
for the process.
