# meetups

A repository of Node meetups. A template is
provided to add your own: simply copy the `template/` directory
to `city-state-country/`, and rename the file to `your-meetup-name.md`,
and send a pull request.

## audience

This repository is intended primarily for node meetup organizers or 
individuals looking to organize a local node meetup -- the intent is
to share meeting formats, lists of talks, other resources. For a list
of node events, see [node-meatspace](https://github.com/mikeal/node-meatspace).
