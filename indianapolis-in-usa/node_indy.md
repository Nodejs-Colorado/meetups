## Formats

### Presentations, Demos, and Social

Node.Indy happens on the 4th Wednesday of each month and includes a
presentation followed by the chance for anybody to demo what they are building
with node.js. After the presentations and demos, it's open to social
interaction; a chance for people to provide or receive help with their projects
or talk about the latest Twitter hot drama.

Pizza and drinks are provided so come hungry and thirsty.

## Process

There are some great local developers working with node.js that love to share
what they have going on. These are the people that present what kind of exciting
things they are doing with node.js.

The organizers facilitate the speakers, the venue, and the food -- feedback can
be sent directly to them either on Twitter or in person.
