## Formats

### Talk Night

Talk nights are held on the first Thursday of the month. They are usually
comprised of one 15 minute lightning talk with two long-form (30-45 minute)
talks.  Attendees are encouraged to ask questions and interact with the speaker
(in a polite way!)

After the meetup, PDXNode usually relocates as a group to one of a few
nearby bars.

### Hack Night

Hack nights are held on 3rd Thursdays, colocating with [SEPoCoNi](http://epdx.org/groups/sepoconi) ("Southeast
Portland Coders Night") at Side Door, a coffee shop/diner/bar. This is more
free-form: there's more emphasis on socializing and hacking than structure. Newbies are encouraged to introduce
themselves by the organizers saying hi to unfamiliar faces, and are asked about what they'd like to work on or 
if they have projects they'd like help with. If new to Node, we point them to various Node resources including
nodeschool.io

### Workshops

Workshops are currently a WIP; most organizers also TA for the local JavaScript
code school.

## Process

Talks are submitted via PR and reviewed by organizers; talk templates are 
provided. Note that this is not a case of "build it and they will come";
Organizers actively seek out and encourage talks from community members excited
about projects they've worked on. Newer members are encouraged to do lightning 
talks: topics include packages they've recently released or found useful, tooling, 
or brief "how-to"'s.

There's also a "request for talk" to allow members who are interested in
a topic request to hear about it at a future meetup; and provide
inspiration for those who want to give a talk.

Once a talk is accepted it is placed in a `YYYY-MM` directory. Additional
talk resources should be added / linked to from there (presentations, code
examples, etc.)
