## formats

### talk night

Talk nights are held on the first Thursday of the month. They are usually
comprised of one 15 minute lightning talk with two long-form (30-45 minute)
talks.  Attendees are encouraged to ask questions and interact with the speaker
(in a polite way!)

After the meetup, PDXNode usually relocates as a group to one of a few
nearby bars.

### hack night

Hack nights are held on 3rd Thursdays, colocating with SEPoCoNi ("Southeast
Portland Coders Night") at Side Door, a coffee shop/diner/bar. This is more
free-form: there's more emphasis on socializing and hacking than structure.

### workshops

Workshops are currently a WIP; most organizers also TA for the local JavaScript
code school.

## process

Talks are submitted via PR and reviewed by organizers; talk templates are 
provided. Note that this is not a case of "build it and they will come";
@hackygolucky actively seek out and encourage talks from the community.
Newer members are encouraged to do lightning talks: topics include
packages they've recently released or found useful, tooling, or brief "how-to"'s.

There's also a "request for talk" to allow members who are interested in
a topic request to hear about it at a future meetup; and provide
inspiration for those who want to give a talk.

Once a talk is accepted it is placed in a `YYYY-MM` directory. Additional
talk resources should be added / linked to from there (presentations, code
examples, etc.)
