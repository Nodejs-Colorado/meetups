## Format

### Meetup

We meet once a month in a local startup office or incubator, inviting speakers from the local community to show case technologies or what they have been working on. Our goals are:

* Encourage members to participate in open-source JS projects.
* Share workflows, tools, tricks & tips, and experience with frameworks that we use on a daily basis.
* Foster a local community of JavaScript developers - but also be welcoming to international visitors.
* Encourage discussion of both "classic" JavaScript environments (i.e., browsers), and also other environments where things like Node.js are making an impact: on servers, Arduinos, and the Raspberry Pi.

## Process
