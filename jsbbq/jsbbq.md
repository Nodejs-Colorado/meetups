### Eat and Drink

Back when I had a huge backyard in Oakland I would run these little meetups when the weather was good. Rather than drinks and food at the end these began with drinks and food, usually around 4 or 5 on a Saturday or Sunday. After it got dark enough to project against a sheet taped to my garage we'd have a few talks.

### Talks

We'd do two talks, around 25 minutes each. Because everyone just spent so much time socializing it was a much more interactive environment than a traditional speaker session. Before my landlord was foreclosed on and I lost the space we had talk by Aaron Quint, Alex Russell, Paul Irish and Guillermo Rauch.

## process

Because the weather had to be right we couldn't do them as often as I would have liked. I would usually buy about a hundred dollars worth of meat, usually ribs and burgers. We'd ask people to bring additional food and drinks, we would usually end up with more beer than we started with.

If people start to bunch up in one area of the yard a good trick is to move the beer to an empty area, a few minutes later people will start to spread out.

I'd just promote it on twitter and we'd stand up a little RSVP couchapp.
